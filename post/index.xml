      <description>GRG is the computer algebra system witch was designed to make calculation in differential geometry and field theory as simple and natural as possible. It’s is based on the computer algebra system REDUCE. Despite the fact that this program was the creation in the nineties at the present time it remains relevant. Unfortunately you can’t find it in standard repositories of Ubuntu or other popular Linux distributives. But you can install it from sources without any problems.</description>
